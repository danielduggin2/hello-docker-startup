# Getting Started with Docker

Create a project. In my case, I created a folder called hello-Docker

From there I created my Dockerfile

# To Run the Project (Once React Setup is complete)

To build out the image

```
docker build -t react-docker .
```

Next run with port mapping

```
docker run -p 5173:5173 react-docker
```

Local now works

# DockerFile Explained

See Dockerfile within hello-docker

# Initializing with Basic React app

First, ensure npm is installed on your machine (HomeBrew for mac or nvm for windows)
Then run the command:

```
npm create vite@latest react-docker
```

Then select your preferences

We do not need to run npm install because dependencies are installed in our dockerized container

From there,

```
cd react-docker
```

# Dockerfile within react-docker

See Dockerfile within react-docker folder
