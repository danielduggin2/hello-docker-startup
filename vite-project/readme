# Docker Compose

A simplified version of the react-docker setup within the repo
After creatinf our project, we just run:

```
docker init
```

It will ask some questions, answer them based on your project needs

# yaml file

After adding volumes to our yaml file, we can run:

```
docker compose up
```

Results may very depending on permissions. On mac/linux, add sudo before the command

You may want to delete current images in Docker desktop (except the one creating right now) to see this process through

# Common Issue

If you get to this point, you most likely forgot to add --host to your vite settings in package.json

Note: You can use CTRL C to stop running the project. This stops the container in Docker desktop instead of creating an absurd amount when you rerun. This is thanks to Docker compose
